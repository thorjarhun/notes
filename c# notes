Snippets:
- ctor
- cw
- testm

- @Annotations are called [attributes]
- "super" is called "base"

- Strings behave like value types

- A "property" is a "field" with custom get/set

- Extract method refactoring feature is awesome!
- Switch statement’s need for verbose breaks seems janky
- When to use struct vs class with “properties” - 16 byte rule
- Unrelated: Should code be broken down into private methods even if they'll only be called once?
- Does a method need to be "virtual" to be overridden? Does the overriding method have to declare "override"? Can you override an overriden method? Does it have to be virtual too?

- MVC3 async controllers look like they were a mess

- yield return? vs just yield?

- extension methods have a ‘this’ prefixed parameter
—- research extension methods

Types of delegates:

- Katana is an implementation of OWIN

- The “as” operator is like a cast operation except that if the conversion isn’t possible, “as” returns null instead of raising an exception.

- Any Value type can be represented as a Nullable type by postfixing ‘?’. E.g. int?.

- Entity framework is an ORM that can be worked with using a *Database*, *Model*, or *Code* first approach.

- Where is the process when I execute “Start Without Debugging”?
